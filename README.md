The User Management System is a web application built with React and TypeScript, featuring user authentication, CRUD operations, and a responsive design. Users can log in to add, edit, delete, and search for users in a dynamic list, with sorting options available. The application supports dark mode using Tailwind CSS, enhancing usability in low-light conditions. By utilizing the JSONPlaceholder API, the system simulates user data, allowing for seamless testing and development. The component-based architecture ensures efficient state management and an intuitive user experience.
